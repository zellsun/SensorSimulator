Take Windows platform as an example:
0) You must have the JRE installed in your system. (Please refer to http://www.java.com)

1) Execute Run_SensorSimulator.bat (Such as by double-click it). For Linux, OS X, Solaris, please use command line: java -jar "./dist/SensorSimulator.jar" 

2) You can adjust values on the panel to send alarms to SoSafe application.

3) You can review network traffic on Network Traffic Log area.

4) Listen to SoSafe Server is optional, because it will not process received data in this version.
